## Project Overview

This project analyzes Netflix data to uncover insights about content trends, viewer preferences, and platform growth patterns.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze content distribution across different genres and categories
- Identify trends in Netflix's content library over time
- Examine geographical content distribution
- Explore relationships between ratings, release years, and content types

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Python and Pandas for data processing and cleaning, with Plotly and Seaborn used for creating visualizations.

## Key Findings

- It seems like Netflix produces much more Movies than TV Shows since the production is almost double that of shows.
- The United States is the leading country in producing content, followed by India and the United Kingdom.

## Insights & Recommendations

### Strategic Content Shift (Movie Dominance vs. TV Growth)

Insight: Movies currently make up 69.7% of the content library, compared to 30.3% for TV Shows.

Recommendation: Continue to emphasize TV Show production since TV Shows drive higher long-term engagement and subscriber retention compared to transactional movie viewing.

### **Bingeability Focus (Single-Season TV Strategy)**

Insight: 67.3% of all TV Shows are only 1 Season long.

Recommendation: Recognize and communicate this strategy. The high proportion of 1-season shows indicates a strategic focus on miniseries, limited series, and "test runs" for new concepts.

### **Genre Strategy: Improving Discovery**

Insight: Current top genre tags primarily separate content by format (Movie vs. TV Show), not by the actual theme (e.g., 'Dramas' are movies, 'TV Dramas' are shows). This means there is missed opportunity to link similar content across the entire library.

Recommendation: Specific tagging system (e.g., using 'Historical,' 'Political,' or 'Teen' tags) for the largest Movie categories. This will immediately improve the recommendation engine, allowing Netflix to seamlessly recommend a relevant TV Show to a Movie viewer, boosting engagement and cross-format discovery.

### **Efficient Talent Management (Top Creative Teams)**

Insight: The top collaborations involve specific director-actor pairings.

Recommendation: Identify and prioritize future projects with these highly productive and successful Director/Actor/Creator teams. They represent proven efficiency in content delivery and can be relied upon for consistent output.

### **Content Targeting and Maturity**

Insight: The TV-MA (Mature Audience) rating is the most frequent rating for TV Shows, and R is a top rating for Movies (as seen in the rating distribution chart).

Recommendation: Double down on acquiring and producing TV-MA and R-rated content in popular genres like Dramas, Thrillers, and Comedies. This content strongly targets the adult subscriber demographic, which drives subscription revenue.
